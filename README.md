👋 Hey there, I'm Nikil Paul S from Hosur, Tamil Nadu! 🇮🇳

🎓 I'm a curious soul with a diverse academic journey. I kicked off my intellectual quest at Gandhigram Rural Institute, where I delved into the intricate world of physics. My choice of physics as an undergrad major was driven by an insatiable desire to unravel the mysteries of the universe we call home. Mathematics, in my opinion, is a potent tool that remains remarkably underrated.

🛠️ During my undergraduate years, I found myself captivated by the realm of electronics and tinkering. I honed my skills in the Arduino IDE, creating projects that bridged the gap between the digital and physical worlds. It was through these hands-on experiences that I learned the art of problem-solving, precision, and innovation.

🔍 Fast forward to today, and I'm on a thrilling journey into the realm of data science. Currently pursuing an MSc in Applied Data Science at SRM, I'm combining my physics background with cutting-edge tools like Python and MATLAB. My transition into the world of data science is driven by an unquenchable thirst for understanding patterns, making informed decisions, and extracting valuable insights from complex datasets.

📚 When I'm not immersed in data or unraveling the mysteries of the universe, you can find me enjoying anime, diving into English series and movies, and of course, relishing memes—the ultimate language of the internet.

🌌 My passion for learning, coupled with my knack for analysis, guides my journey as I navigate the realms of both science and technology. Join me as I embrace the exciting interplay between these domains and continue to explore the vast expanse of knowledge.
